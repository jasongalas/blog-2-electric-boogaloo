# blog-2-electric-boogaloo
The sequel

## Description

A blast from the past, we were charged with creating another blog site, one with additional functionality. So, I decided to reskin my module 4 with the bells and whistles of login capabilities, SQL databases for storing the blog posts, and the ability to comment on other blogs that were required. Set-up had been something that we'd been taught from the beginning, and set-up was truly the name of the game in this module.

## Installation

This will work in any browser so long as you have the working render link:

## Usage

You can access the homepage at any point in time. However, in order to actually blog, you'll have to login, or sign up to log in. In either case, once you've obtained access to Blog 2, you can create, read, update, and delete the posts you write, as well as comment on the other posts that exist in the site.
